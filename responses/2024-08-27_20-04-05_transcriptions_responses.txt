Response [2]:
 Inception is a mind-bending science fiction film about a thief, Dom (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), who specializes in extracting valuable information from his targets' dreams. One day, he is offered an unprecedented challenge: instead of stealing an idea from someone's mind, he must plant one there, a task that requires him to navigate multiple levels of dreams while facing dangerous repercussions from his own past.
